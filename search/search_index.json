When running on PACE, using sudo is not allowed without special permissions. Hence getting git installed would be hard to do. Instead for ease, just download the files and use PACE ICE onDemand and upload the files onto the instance machine directly, without using git. 2. The requirements file has a LOT of libraries, many which are outdated and will give compilation errors. You will have to see which ones would work, and whenever an error occurs pip install seperatley and keep running the file. This is tedious. An issue that isnt resolved yet is the complilation problems with the Cython libraries with pandas and others. 3. The GitHub will ask to make a virtual environment using myenv. In PACE you should use Ananconda, which comes along with it. 4. Kaggle API is a bit different with the outdated version of this Kaggle competition. Ther emay be multiple times where you have to uninstall kaggle and reinstall it. Scroll down here. Issues occurs where the files for Kaggle are not aligned with the process of getting training data. So you would have to download the training data and upload it onto PACE. 5. There was an issue uploading the training files onto PACE, as it keeps giving an error that it cant upload half of the files. Will have to figure this one out later. </p>"},{"location":"Projects/Sp24/Microclimate/","title":"Microclimate","text":"<p>test</p>"},{"location":"Projects/Sp24/Mobility-1/","title":"Mobility 1","text":"<p>test</p>"},{"location":"Projects/Sp24/Mobility-2/","title":"Mobility 2","text":"<p>test</p>"},{"location":"Teams/Students/","title":"Student team members","text":"","tags":["Energy","Microclimate","Mobility"]},{"location":"Teams/Students/#spring-2024","title":"Spring 2024","text":"Name GitHub Team Tag Major Department Shivam Patel FlippyShivam Energy In Buildings Computer Science Abigail Herbas aherbas3 Energy In Buildings Computer Science Student 1 Mechanical Engineering 23.99 Student 1 Architecture 19.99 Student 1 Computer Engineering 42.99","tags":["Energy","Microclimate","Mobility"]}]}
